# ES Theme A Touch of Glass
 A new theme for Emulationstation best for 16/9 screens There's 5 system views and 4 gamelist views + 3 sets of logos I reused a logo animation from ckau but slightly edited it so thank you to him I really dislike coding so reuse things where possible. Thank you as well to harryoke for sharing his accrylic template
